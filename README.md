# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

Driver drowsiness has become one of the main reasons for large number of road accidents. The main aim of this project is to overcome road accidents related to drivers experiencing fatigue leads to a need of developing a system that keeps the driver focused on the road. With the evolution and improvement in Computer Vision technologies, smart /intelligent cameras and alarms are developed to predict drowsiness in drivers, thereby alerting drivers, reducing accidents when they are feeling drowsy. Hence, cameras can be useful for monitoring driverâ€™s activities while alarms can notify driver and make him alert about his drowsy & tired eyes and no longer capable of driving. To extract eye region from face images, Open CV algorithms and Haar Classifier is used.
